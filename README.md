### Analyses:
In this series of modeling analyses , we tested potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different policies with varying re-opening timing, rollback strategies, testing strategies, and occupancy guidelines.  
We hope these analyses would be helpful to other municipalities as well.

- Report 1 (date: 5/26/20; details in folder test1*) analyzed potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City for three policies with different re-opening schedules. 

- Report 2 (date: 6/3/20; details in folders test2*) analyzed potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different re-opening/rollback policies along with active universal infection testing. 

- Report 3 (date: 6/30/20; details in folder test3*) analyzed potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different re-opening occupancy guidelines and rollback strategies. 

### CAUTION:  
1) All results are preliminary - please use with caution.
2) The three rounds of testing/analysis are built on findings from previous round(s) and should be considered collectively.
3) For consideration/use for locales other than New York City, please take into account local conditions.
